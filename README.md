This is a program I wrote for my TI-84 calculator. It calculates the probability of type II error (β) in statistics.

The 8xp is the compiled version of the text file. I used the tools at https://www.cemetech.net/sc/ to write and compile the program. To read the program and see how it works, see the text file. If you want to use the program without editing it, just download the 8xp program and put it on your calculator (I assume you know how to safely put stuff on your calculator). If you want to use the program, but want to edit it first, download the .txt file, edit it, and compile it into a 8xp program.

NOTE: This program is offered without any guarantee of
* it working,
* it giving correct results,
* it not ruining your calculator,
* it keeping your variables,
* it not ending the world. 

By downloading and/or using it, you accept all responsibilty for any damages stemming from the program or the use thereof. You also accept any responsibility for damages to your calculator, your computer, or other damages resulting from trying to do anything mentioned (ie, using the program, using the web site, trying to connect your calculator to your computer, editing a .txt file, etc).

About the variables: I wrote this program to use several letters as variables (for instance, it stores the β value in B). This program temporarily stores all the variables' values in a list (L1), and puts the values back at the end of the program and restores L1 to its original state. However, if the program is exited partway through, you're going to have to reset those values by hand; they should be in L1.

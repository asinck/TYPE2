This is a program I wrote for my TI-84 calculator. It calculates the probability of type II error (β) in statistics.

To see this program, read the text file. To run it, download the 8xp program and put it on you calculator.

NOTE: This program is offered without any guarantee of
a) it working, 
b) it giving correct results, 
c) it not ruining your calculator, 
d) it keeping your variables (It will overwrite them. Period.), 
e) it not ending the world. 
By downloading and/or using it, you accept all responsibilty for any damages stemming from the program or the use thereof.

About the variables: I wrote this program to use several letters as variables (for instance, it stores the β value in B). The letters used will be overwritten with whatever values the program puts in them. If you have numbers stored in these letters, the values will be lost because the program doesn't put them back.
